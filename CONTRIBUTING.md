# Contributing to Hive

Thank you for helping improve KubeStellar Hive. This guide is for contributing code and documentation to this repository. If you want to donate compute to a running hive, see [Contribute to a Hive](README.md#contribute-to-a-hive) instead.

**New here?** Start with the [getting-started guide for first-time contributors](docs/getting-started-contributing.md) — it walks the end-to-end journey (finding an issue, local setup, testing without a cluster, key concepts, and what the review/CI process looks like) and links back into this guide for the mechanics.

## Where to work

- Open issues and pull requests in this repository. Use the issue templates when they are available, and link related issues from the PR body.
- Discuss design and review questions in GitHub issues and PRs so decisions remain public and searchable.
- Follow the [KubeStellar Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Hive governance](GOVERNANCE.md).
- Report vulnerabilities privately; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Contributing to the tuna-os fork

This repository is a fork of [`hivecommons/hive`](https://github.com/hivecommons/hive) that Tuna OS maintains. The fork has very few changes. Only fork-specific configuration (CI `runs-on` values for GitHub Actions) is kept here. Other changes are sent upstream.

### When to contribute upstream vs. this fork

**Contribute upstream** if your change is:
- A bug fix that affects all Hive deployments
- A feature that improves Hive (not Tuna OS-specific)
- A documentation improvement that applies to all users
- A dependency update or code quality improvement

Generic work that is merged upstream automatically goes into this fork at the next sync. This means you do not duplicate the work.

**Contribute to this fork** if your change is:
- Tuna OS-specific configuration or policy
- A workflow or CI change for Tuna OS infrastructure
- Documentation about running Hive on Tuna OS
- A temporary fix that is waiting for upstream acceptance

### Fork sync policy

This fork syncs with upstream `v4` at regular times (see [FORK.md](FORK.md) for details). When syncing:

1. Syncs use **merge commits** to keep upstream history
2. The only intentional difference is CI configuration: `runs-on: [ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-24.04-arm]` instead of upstream's `[self-hosted, hive]`
3. This difference is re-applied automatically on every sync
4. Bug fixes and features go upstream first. PRs to this fork should rarely change `src/` or `bin/`

### Before starting work

If you are not sure whether your change belongs upstream or here:
1. Check [FORK.md](FORK.md). It explains what belongs where.
2. Open a GitHub discussion or add a comment to an existing issue. Ask a maintainer.
3. Reference the upstream repository if your change might apply there too.

Generic bug fixes and features to upstream are encouraged. They help all Hive users and reduce differences between this fork and upstream.

## Repository layout

- `src/` — the current Go module (`github.com/hivecommons/hive`) and the main development target for this repository.
  - `src/cmd/hive` — main Hive binary.
  - `src/cmd/hivectl`, `src/cmd/apiproxy`, `src/cmd/hive-backup` — supporting command-line tools.
  - `src/pkg/` — Go packages for agents, GitHub integration, scheduling, policies, dashboards, hubs, backups, and related runtime behavior.
  - `src/policies/` — policy prompts and rule files used by the deterministic/agent pipeline. Treat policy changes like code: review the behavior they enable, test where possible, and explain risk in the PR.
  - `src/deploy/` and `src/examples/` — deployment manifests and example configuration.
  - `src/docs/` — architecture and operator/developer reference material.
  - `src/test/` — integration and regression tests.
- `bin/` — deterministic pipeline, supervision, enforcement, deployment, and maintainer helper scripts. See [`bin/README.md`](bin/README.md) for the script-by-script index.
- `config/hive-project.yaml.example` — project metadata for the top-level
  deterministic shell pipeline; see [config/README.md](config/README.md). This
  is separate from the Go runtime config in `src/hive.yaml.example`.
- `dashboard/`, `docs/`, `config/`, `systemd/`, `launchd/`, and top-level scripts — supporting assets for hub, dashboard, installation, and operational workflows.
- `Justfile` — contributor relay recipes; see [Just recipes](docs/development.md#just-recipes).

## Branches

Use `v4` as the base branch for Hive work and PRs unless a maintainer asks otherwise. The `main` branch is not the active target for changes.

Before starting work:

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch -c <topic-branch> origin/v4
```

## Local development

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for the full local setup guide. The short path is:

```bash
cd src
go build ./...
go test ./...
```

The Go version is declared in [`src/go.mod`](src/go.mod). Install that version or newer compatible tooling before building.

## Contributor `just` recipes

The root [`Justfile`](Justfile) exposes the public contributor relay workflow. Run `just --list` to see the current recipe signatures; private implementation details are intentionally not listed there.

| Recipe | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `just contribute-check <backend>` | Runs the same read-only backend CLI preflight used by setup, then reports whether the machine is ready for `contribute-setup`. |
| `just contribute-setup <backend>` | Checks the Justfile version, verifies the backend CLI, signs in with GitHub, registers with the configured hub, and writes `${HOME}/.config/hive/contributor.env`. |
| `just contribute-hive [backend] [mode]` | Starts the contributor relay. The default mode is containerized; pass `local` as the mode to run natively when the local tools are installed. |
| `just contribute-status` | Queries the configured hub for status and contributor profile information. |
| `just contribute-browse` | Discovers available public hive projects. |
| `just contribute-stop` | Stops a background contributor relay if one is running. |
| `just contribute-k8s [namespace] [outfile] [image_tag]` | Emits Kubernetes manifests for a headless contributor workload. It writes to stdout or the requested file; it does not apply the manifest. |
| `just hive-api <endpoint>` | Calls a hub API endpoint, defaulting to `/status`, using the configured hive URL. |
| `just hive-api-docs` | Opens the hub API documentation in a browser. |

See [src/docs/contributor-relay.md](src/docs/contributor-relay.md) for the end-to-end contributor relay workflow and Kubernetes workload details.

## Style and quality

- Format Go changes with `gofmt`.
- Prefer small, focused PRs with tests or a clear explanation when tests are not practical.
- Keep configuration values configurable instead of hard-coding environment-specific paths, tokens, or endpoints.
- Do not commit secrets, generated credentials, or local runtime state.
- For documentation changes, verify every command, path, and branch name you mention.

## Test policy

**A change to behavior must come with a test that would fail without it.** This
is the project's standing expectation, not a per-PR negotiation.

- **Bug fixes** add a test that reproduces the bug — one that fails on the
  parent commit and passes on the fix. A fix whose test passes either way has
  not demonstrated it fixes anything.
- **New functionality** adds tests covering its normal path and the failure
  modes a caller can actually hit.
- **Security-relevant changes** assert the invariant, not the implementation.
  A test that merely calls a guard proves nothing; it must fail when the guard
  is removed.
- **Tests are in scope for review.** A test asserting the wrong thing is worse
  than no test, because it reports green while the behavior is broken.

Where a test is genuinely impractical — a change that only affects real cloud
infrastructure, or a docs-only edit — say so in the PR body and explain what
you did to verify it instead. "Tests not practical" without that explanation is
a reason for a reviewer to push back.

Static analysis runs in CI (`go vet`, `golangci-lint`, `gosec`, and
`govulncheck`; see [`.github/workflows/go-security-analysis.yml`](.github/workflows/go-security-analysis.yml)).
Fix findings rather than suppressing them; when a suppression is genuinely
right, comment why at the suppression site.

## Optional git hooks

The repository includes `githooks/post-checkout`. Install it only if you want the local checkout guard:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath githooks
```

The hook runs after branch checkouts in the primary worktree. It prevents that worktree from staying on a branch other than `main` by printing guidance and checking `main` back out. It is intended for long-running dashboard checkouts where feature work should happen in separate `git worktree add ...` directories. It does not run for file checkouts or linked worktrees, because linked worktrees have a `.git` file instead of a `.git` directory.

If the hook is not installed, normal Git behavior applies. If it blocks a checkout unexpectedly, use a separate worktree from an unprotected checkout or remove the hooksPath setting for repositories where the guard is not desired.

## DCO sign-off

Every commit must include a Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off. Use:

```bash
git commit -s
```

The sign-off adds a `Signed-off-by:` trailer certifying that you have the right to submit the contribution under this repository's license. If you forget, amend the commit with `git commit --amend -s` and force-push your branch.

## Pull requests

- Target `v4` for all code and documentation contributions (the active development branch).
- Start PR titles with the repository's emoji convention, for example `📖 docs: ...`, `🐛 fix: ...`, or `✨ feature: ...`.
- Include `Fixes #<issue>` lines for issues the PR closes.
- Describe what changed, why, and how you tested it.
- Include the relevant command output or a short note such as `Not run (docs only)` when tests are not applicable.
- Add a changelog fragment under [`changelog.d/`](changelog.d/README.md) for user-visible changes — features, fixes, security changes, migrations, deprecations, and breaking changes (see "Changelog fragments" below). Routine refactors, test-only changes, and dependency churn are explicitly out of scope — add the `no-changelog` label if the advisory `changelog-fragment-guard` check asks anyway. Do **not** append to `CHANGELOG.md`'s `## Unreleased` section directly: every PR editing that one shared heading is what made unrelated PRs merge-conflict with each other ([#5675](https://github.com/hivecommons/hive/issues/5675)); fragments are compiled into [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) automatically at release time.
- Expect maintainers to ask for focused follow-up changes rather than broad drive-by edits.

## Changelog fragments

One file per PR, named `changelog.d/<category>-<pr-or-slug>.md` where the category (`added`, `changed`, `deprecated`, `fixed`, `security`) picks the CHANGELOG subsection — and, through it, the semver bump of the next release. The file's content is exactly your entry: a single `- ` bullet in the same narrative style as existing `CHANGELOG.md` entries, no headings. The complete workflow:

```bash
echo '- The relay no longer drops long tasks ([#1234](https://github.com/hivecommons/hive/issues/1234)).' > changelog.d/fixed-1234-relay-drop.md
git add changelog.d/fixed-1234-relay-drop.md
git commit -s
```

`changelog.d/README.md` has the full format, the `no-changelog` exemption, and the release-marker escape hatch. Transition note: direct `CHANGELOG.md` edits are still accepted until 2026-09-09 so in-flight PRs can land unreworked.

## Maintainer resources

Project governance lives in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md). The current owner/approver signal is also reflected in [OWNERS](OWNERS). Security disclosure is handled through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not public issues.
