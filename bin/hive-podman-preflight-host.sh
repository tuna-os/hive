# Podman preflight: SELinux, mounts, secrets, and ports (#4209).
#
# Three of the most common ways a standalone Podman deployment fails on a
# Fedora/RHEL-class host have nothing to do with the engine itself, and all
# three surface as an unhelpful error long after `podman run` has already
# started making changes:
#
#   1. SELinux is enforcing and the bind-mount sources carry a host label the
#      container type cannot read, so the process inside sees EACCES on a file
#      that is plainly mode 0644 on the host.
#   2. The configuration file or the secrets directory is absent, unreadable by
#      the user the engine actually runs as, or readable by everyone on the box.
#   3. Something already holds the port the gateway is about to publish, or the
#      port is below the rootless unprivileged-port floor.
#
# This layer diagnoses exactly those and stops. It is read-only: it starts no
# container, relabels nothing, changes no mode or owner, writes nothing to the
# host, and contacts no registry.
#
# Deliberate non-goals, so the remediation advice stays honest:
#
#   * Disabling SELinux is never offered as the fix. Every remediation here is
#     a labeling or policy action that leaves the kernel enforcing.
#   * Secret permissions are never broadened, and never changed at all. Modes
#     that are too open are reported with the command to NARROW them; the
#     operator runs it.
#   * Host firewall rules, port reservations, and running processes are left
#     exactly as they are.
#
# The engine, connection, root mode, and cgroup layer is #4207; subordinate
# IDs, graphroot, and networking are #4208.

# --- 2. Mount labeling -------------------------------------------------------
#
# TWO LAYOUTS, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT COSMETIC (#4422).
#
# This check knew only the source-tree layout — the one the Compose stack mounts
# out of a checkout, where the gateway config sits at `deploy/nginx.conf`. The
# Quadlet install (src/docs/podman-standalone-quadlet.md) puts the operator's
# files in `%E/hive` with `nginx.conf` FLAT, so pointing this script at that
# directory reported
#
#   ✗ Gateway config: <dir>/deploy/nginx.conf does not exist
#
# and exited 78 with the file sitting right there, one level up. That landed on
# the one install path where this check is most useful: SELinux labelling of
# those binds is exactly the class of problem that otherwise surfaces as a
# 300-second start timeout with the container already `--rm`'d away. A non-zero
# exit also invites an operator to stop reading a report whose other rows —
# mount labels, the secrets group-traverse check, port 3001 — they still need.
#
# The recommended relabel option differs by layout too, and getting THAT
# backwards would be worse than the path bug:
#
#   source-tree   the config files are part of the operator's CHECKOUT and are
#                 likely read by other tooling, so `:z` (shared) is right and
#                 `:Z` would stamp a per-container MCS category onto a tracked
#                 file.
#   quadlet       the config files are operator-owned files in %E/hive read by
#                 exactly ONE container, and the shipped units mount all three
#                 `:ro,Z`. Recommending `:z` there would contradict the units.

Reports the SELinux mode and Podman's labeling state, the SELinux labels on
every bind-mount source, whether the Hive configuration and secrets are
readable by the right user and nobody else, the network backend and aardvark-dns
availability, and whether the published host ports are free.

Read-only. It starts no container, relabels nothing, changes no permission or
owner, and contacts no registry. It never proposes disabling SELinux and never
proposes widening access to a secret.

Runs only when HIVE_DEPLOY_RUNTIME selects podman; with the Docker default it
reports that it was skipped and exits 0.

Environment:
  HIVE_SRC_DIR                    directory holding the deployment's bind sources
  HIVE_PODMAN_LAYOUT              auto (default) | source | quadlet — which shape
                                  HIVE_SRC_DIR has. A source tree (Compose) keeps
                                  the gateway config at deploy/nginx.conf; a
                                  Quadlet install keeps it flat as nginx.conf in
                                  %E/hive, alongside hive.env. auto decides from
                                  what is on disk and prints which it picked.
