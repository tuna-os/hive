// contribute_lease_restart_test.go covers kubestellar/hive#5681: a hub restart made
// every in-flight contributor task unresumable.
//
// Leases lived only in process memory. A restart — which self-upgrade rolls (#5391)
// make routine — emptied the registry while the relays carried on working, so every
// reconnecting relay failed lookupLease, was answered "no active lease for this
// task", had its agent interrupted mid-turn, and was handed the identical issue back
// seconds later. Observed 2026-09-02: revoked at 14:24:40, the same issue reassigned
// to the same relay at 14:24:44, discarding two and a half minutes of a turn that was
// progressing normally.
//
// #4260's contribute_reconnect_resume_test.go pins the resume contract across a
// SOCKET drop and passes throughout, because that reconnect is to a live hub. These
// tests exercise the same contract across a PROCESS boundary, which had no coverage.

// restartedHub returns a second hub built over the same on-disk state as the first,
// which is what a hub restart is: a new process, an empty connection table, and
// whatever the previous process persisted. covK2Hub reuses HIVE_CONTRIBUTORS_DIR once
// it is set, so the second call boots against the first call's files.
