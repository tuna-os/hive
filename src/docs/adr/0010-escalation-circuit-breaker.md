# ADR-0010: Escalation circuit breaker for CI fix loops

Status: Accepted (retroactive)

## Context

Hive agents can repair their own failing PRs, but an unbounded retry loop can
keep re-dispatching blind fixes without surfacing the root CI error. The
escalation package records the incident that forced this boundary: a console
test split kept `main` red for days while scanner fix PRs missed the one-line
failure in shard logs ([escalation package](../../pkg/escalation/escalation.go)).

## Decision

Track red PRs in a persistent ledger keyed by `repo#number`. Each sweep records
distinct failing head SHAs, retains the last CI excerpt, clears history when a
PR goes green, and marks escalation once the threshold is crossed. The default
threshold is three distinct red SHAs. When escalation fires, Hive posts a comment
headed "Fix loop escalated — human attention needed", includes failing checks
and raw failure evidence when available, and applies the `needs-human` label so
future fix dispatch skips the PR.

For unchanged red heads, track staleness separately and cap re-engagements at
three per current SHA. A branch that moves resets the re-engagement counter; a
permanently red, never-moving branch is not nudged forever.

The `needs-human` label on the forge, not the ledger, is the authoritative
record that a PR has been escalated. The ledger is a cache of it: a PR that
wears the label reads as escalated even to an empty ledger (so the evidence
comment is never posted twice, whatever happens to `/data`), and a PR whose
confirmed label a human removes is un-parked with a fresh budget. A pass that
cannot conclude CI state (checks running, or the check-run fetch failed — both
surface as `pending`) leaves the ledger untouched; only a conclusive green
clears history. Entries are pruned 24h after their PR stops being enumerated,
not on the first pass that misses it.

Dependency bots (`renovate[bot]`, `dependabot[bot]`, `mergeraptor[bot]`) are
not agent authors: their red PRs are not fix loops to break.

A required check failing on every conclusive open PR in a repository is treated
as a shared CI failure when the evidence includes both a Hive-authored PR and
an independently authored control. Hive removes that check from each PR's
escalation observation. If no PR-specific failures remain, the observation is
inconclusive: it neither consumes the PR's fix budget nor clears its history.
The operator log names the repository and shared check so alerting can target
the underlying condition instead of labeling every affected PR `needs-human`.
A green control or a failure observed only on Hive-authored changes keeps the
normal per-PR behavior.

## Consequences

The fleet stops spending cycles on fix loops that are not converging and gives a
human the evidence needed to unblock the PR. The ledger is deterministic and
language-agnostic: it keys on CI state, head SHAs, and elapsed time rather than
agent judgment. The trade-off is that some recoverable failures will require
manual label removal after the cap, and stale/failure detection depends on the
quality of CI observations and excerpts available during enumeration.
