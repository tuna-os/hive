# The agent turn model and where in-process state lives (#4002)

Status: **spike / investigation — steps 1 and 2 complete, no production
decision taken.**

Step 1 of RFC #4002 documented how hive drives an agent turn **today** and where
per-agent state lives that would not survive a process restart. Step 2 now adds
an isolated, contribute-shaped prototype in `pkg/turn`: a re-entrant `Step`
function over a serialized conversation envelope, with journaled external
effects and crash/reload tests. Nothing constructs it in the live tmux agent
loop or contributor relay. Steps 3 (handoff path) and 4 (feasibility + migration
cost) remain untouched.

See [`docs/rfc-4002-phased-roadmap.md`](../../../docs/rfc-4002-phased-roadmap.md) for how these steps phase into a delivery plan.

Every claim below carries a `file:line` citation against `origin/v4` at the time
of writing. Line numbers drift; the function names are the durable handle. Where
the RFC's framing does not survive contact with the code, this page says so
plainly — that is the main thing a spike is for.

## Summary of findings

1. **There is no "turn" in the code.** No `Turn` type, no per-turn context, no
   per-turn goroutine, no turn return value. A turn is an emergent property of
   pane text: it begins when hive types a prompt into a tmux pane and ends when
   the pane matches an idle-input-prompt marker again.
2. **There is no agent-owned conversation to externalize.** Hive never holds the
   conversation. The backend CLI does, in its own private on-disk format, and
   hive treats it as opaque. Hive durably records the **prompts it sent** and a
   **rendered-text transcript of the terminal**, and neither is a conversation.
3. **Hive already externalizes a lot of per-agent state** — via
   `/data/hive-state.json` — but that state is *control-plane* state (paused,
   pins, restart counts, backoff ladders), not *conversation* state.
4. **A restart does not resume a turn; it abandons one.** `Restart` kills the
   CLI and the tmux session outright, and the replacement receives no prompt at
   all until the governor's next tick happens to find it due — the kick that
   arrives carries no signal that a restart occurred.
5. **The one thing that does survive is accidental, not designed**, and it works
   only when the tmux server outlives the hive process — which a pod roll or an
   image upgrade rules out.

---

## 1. How a turn is actually driven

### 1.1 The CLI is long-lived; the turn is not a process

The backend CLI is launched **once per tmux session**, as an interactive
foreground process typed into a shell pane, and it stays there across many
turns. `launchInTmux` creates a detached shell session
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:1822`, `newSessionCommands`, which issues a plain
`tmux new-session -d` at `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:1838`) and then *types the CLI
invocation into that shell*:

```go
m.tmuxSendLiteralForAgent(agent, fullCmd)   // src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2634
time.Sleep(textToEnterDelay)
m.tmuxSendEntersForAgent(agent)             // src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2636
```

The composed command line is per-backend and is built as a string —
`claude --model … --dangerously-skip-permissions`
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2429`), `copilot … --allow-all`
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2456`), and so on.

Nothing in the kick path ever spawns a process. `deliverKickLocked`
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:4647`) only manipulates the existing pane.

### 1.2 A turn starts with simulated keystrokes

`SendKick` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:4569`) is the entry point; it delegates to
`deliverKickLocked` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:4647`), which:

- clears any stale input with `C-c` then `C-u`
  (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:4656`),
- types the prompt literally, chunked, via
  `tmuxSendLiteralForAgent` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:4683`, implementation at
  `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:4974` → `tmux send-keys -l`),
- submits with `tmuxSendEntersForAgent` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:4697`).

The prompt reaches the model the same way a human's keyboard would. There is no
API call, no stdin pipe, and no structured request that hive could inspect,
replay, or hand to another process.

### 1.3 A turn "ends" when the pane looks idle

Nothing calls `Wait()` on the CLI for a turn — the process does not exit between
turns, so there is no exit to wait for. Turn completion is **inferred from pane
text**, by two independent mechanisms:

**The readiness gate before the next kick.**
`waitForInputPromptForAgent` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:3885`) polls
`captureTmuxPaneForAgent` and returns once `paneShowsInputPrompt`
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:3814`) matches a per-backend marker string. `SendKick`
calls it at `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:4627`. This gate is the only thing that
stops hive typing a new prompt on top of an in-flight response.

The gate is bounded by `inputPromptTimeout` (120s), which is why operator kicks
from the dashboard do **not** use `SendKick` directly. `SendKickAsync`
(`src/pkg/agent/kick_async.go`) keeps the fast, deterministic preconditions
synchronous and runs this gate plus the typing on a background goroutine, so the
HTTP handler cannot outlive an ingress idle timeout and report a succeeding kick
as a 504 failure (kubestellar/hive#5325). Delivery is deduplicated per agent, so
a retried click cannot type the prompt twice. The governor's tick still calls
`SendKick` synchronously — it has no proxy in front of it.

**The pane poller.** `pollTmuxOutputForAgent`
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2847`) runs a `3 * time.Second` ticker
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2848`) for the agent's whole lifetime, diffing
captured pane content to maintain `agent.LastPaneChange`
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2906`) — hive's only evidence that a running,
authenticated CLI is actually doing something.

Stall recovery is likewise textual: `nudgeIfKickStalled`
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:5597`) compares `paneContentHash(pane)` against
`agent.lastInferKickPane` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:5611`), and
`paneShowsActiveWork` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:5545`) matches a spinner or a
token-counter marker.

### 1.4 Scheduling: one shared ticker, not a per-turn continuation

**Correction to the task framing: `src/pkg/agent/scheduler.go` does not exist.**
Kick *timing* lives in `pkg/governor`; kick *text* is built in `pkg/scheduler`.

- `Governor.agentsDueForKick` (`src/pkg/governor/governor.go:632`) compares
  `now - LastKick` against each agent's configured cadence
  (`AgentCadence`, `src/pkg/governor/governor.go:24`).
- `Governor.Evaluate` (`src/pkg/governor/governor.go:311`) calls it at
  `src/pkg/governor/governor.go:389` and returns the due list.
- The driving loop is a single ticker in `main`:
  `time.NewTicker(… EvalIntervalS …)` at `src/cmd/hive/main.go:4700`, loop at
  `src/cmd/hive/main.go:4754`, evaluation at `src/cmd/hive/main.go:5791`,
  message assembly via `sched.BuildKickMessages` at `src/cmd/hive/main.go:5960`
  (`src/pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go:425`), and delivery via
  `agentMgr.SendKick` at `src/cmd/hive/main.go:6034`.

This matters for the RFC: the scheduler is already **stateless with respect to
turns**. It does not hold a continuation, does not await turn *N* before
planning turn *N+1*, and reconstructs the entire decision each tick from
`LastKick` timestamps. The control loop is arguably closer to the RFC's model
than the RFC assumes. The suspended state is not in the scheduler — it is in the
CLI subprocess.

## 2. Where per-agent state lives

### 2.1 Durable — survives a process restart

| State | Where | Citation |
|---|---|---|
| Pause flag (one bool per agent) | `/data/hive.yaml` via `AgentConfig.Paused` | `src/pkg/config/config.go:856`; writer `SetAgentPausedAndSave` `src/pkg/config/config.go:5040` |
| Pause provenance (`PausedAt`, `PausedReason`, `PausedTrigger`, `PausedBy`), CLI/model pins, model/backend overrides, restart count, `LastKick`, truncated kick history | `/data/hive-state.json` via `snapshot.AgentState` | `src/pkg/snapshot/state.go:78-101`; path `src/cmd/hive/main.go:1738` |
| Watchdog failure count, crash-loop latch, backoff deadline, healthy-since, conditions | same file, `snapshot.PersistedState.Watchdog` | `src/pkg/snapshot/state.go:41`; `watchdog.PersistedAgent` `src/pkg/watchdog/reconciler.go:187` |
| Fleet-breaker engagement + held set | same file, `BreakerState` | `src/pkg/snapshot/state.go:49` |
| Governor budget/spend/eval history, cadence overrides, ACMM level | same file | `src/pkg/snapshot/state.go:16-42` |
| **Full text of every delivered prompt** | `/data/prompt-history.jsonl` (lumberjack-rotated JSONL) | `src/pkg/dashboard/prompt_history.go:44`; writer `Server.RecordPrompt` `src/pkg/dashboard/prompt_history.go:365`, wired at `src/cmd/hive/main.go:3077` |
| **Rendered terminal scrollback, per kick** | `/data/logs/kicks/<agent>/<ts>-<reason>.log` | `src/pkg/agent/kick_logs.go:43` (`defaultKickLogDir`); writer `archiveKickLogLocked` `src/pkg/agent/kick_logs.go:196` |
| Token-usage summary | `/data/metrics/token-summary.json` | `src/pkg/tokens/collector.go:85`, `:121` |
| Structured audit trail | `/data/audit.jsonl`, reloaded into a ring at boot | `src/pkg/dashboard/audit.go:22`, `loadFromDisk` `:88` |
| Agent-name → UID allocation | `/var/run/hive/uid-map.json` | `UIDMapPath` `src/pkg/agent/uidmap.go:17`; load `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:1467` |
| Backend CLI's own session/credential files | the CLI's own `HOME` / `CODEX_HOME`, rooted at `/data/home` | per-agent `CODEX_HOME` `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:8490`, helper `:7254`; per-agent HOME `src/pkg/agent/interactive_home.go:57`; shared `.claude` bridged by symlink `interactive_home.go:74` |

Two caveats on that table:

- The UID map is the one entry **not** rooted at the `/data` PVC. `/var/run` is
  conventionally ephemeral, so whether it survives a pod restart depends on the
  deployment's volume configuration rather than on the code. The load path
  treats absence as a recoverable fallback
  (`src/cmd/hive/main.go:1472`), so this is a durability *asymmetry* rather than
  a known failure — noted here because it is the only place the otherwise
  consistent "durable means `/data`" rule does not hold.
- The last row is the important one for the RFC and is discussed in §5.

### 2.2 In-process — lost on restart

All of the following are fields of `AgentProcess`
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:226`) or goroutines owned by the manager. None is
written anywhere.

| State | Field / mechanism | Citation |
|---|---|---|
| Live output ring buffer | `OutputBuffer *RingBuffer` — pure in-memory circular slice, no persistence path | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:251`; `src/pkg/agent/ringbuffer.go` |
| Last captured pane content | `lastPaneCapture []string`, guarded by `paneMu` | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:252-253` |
| Activity clock | `LastPaneChange` (guarded by `paneMu`) | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:300` |
| Most recent kick text | `LastKickMessage` — replaced on every kick; the durable copy is truncated (`KickRecord.Snippet`) or lives in prompt-history | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:254`; explicitly called out at `src/pkg/dashboard/prompt_history.go:25-30` |
| tmux session/socket identity | `tmuxSession`, `tmuxSocket` | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:260-261` |
| Per-launch cancel func and launch generation | `cancel context.CancelFunc`, `launchGen int` | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:262`, `:319` |
| Launch-serialization flag | `launching bool` (guarded by `m.mu`) | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:272` |
| One-shot bootstrap override | `BootstrapOverride` | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:274` |
| Token-restart backoff ladder | `lastTokenRestart`, `tokenRestartAttempts`, `tokenRestartGaveUp` | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:276`, `:285`, `:287` |
| Login / quota observations | `NeedsLogin`, `QuotaExhausted` | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:288-289` |
| Consent-screen watcher timers | `consentSeenAt`, `lastConsentDismiss` | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:308-309` |
| Stall-watchdog per-kick state | `lastInferKickAt`, `lastInferKickPane`, `stallNudgeSent`, `lastInferKickMarks`, `actionNudgeSent` | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:310-312`, `:320`, `:328` |
| Transient-API-error nudge cooldown | `lastTransientNudge`, `transientNudgesThisKick` | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:316-317` |
| Un-archived-scrollback flag | `kickLogPending` (guarded by `m.mu`) | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:327` |
| Sandbox / bob-key latches, last launch banner | `sandboxResumeAfterCancel`, `awaitingBobKey`, `lastLaunchFailureBanner` | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:330`, `:337`, `:346` |
| Poller goroutines themselves | `go m.pollTmuxOutputForAgent(agent, agentCtx)` and siblings, tied to a per-launch context | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2567`, `:2571`, `:2577` |
| Blocked-action thrash windows | `Manager.thrash map[string]*thrashState` under its own `thrashMu` — deliberately *not* `m.mu`, to avoid re-entrancy from the output-capture goroutines | `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:421-425`; `thrashState` `:3655`; trip logic `recordBlockedAndCheck` `:3660` |

Note the asymmetry: several counters that exist precisely to *stop a runaway
loop* (`tokenRestartAttempts`, `transientNudgesThisKick`, `stallNudgeSent`) are
in-process only. A restart resets each of them to zero. The watchdog's own
backoff ladder is persisted (`src/pkg/watchdog/reconciler.go:345`) specifically
so that it doesn't have this property; the manager-side nudge counters were not
given the same treatment. This is an observation about current behaviour, not a
bug report — see Open questions.

### 2.3 tmux state, and the one accidental survival path

tmux is a separate process tree with its own server per agent socket
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:1767` builds `tmux -L <socket>`). What tmux holds —
the running CLI process and its scrollback — is therefore outside hive's memory
and *can* outlive a hive process restart.

`launchInTmux` exploits this. If the pane already shows a CLI marker and no
relaunch was forced, hive **adopts the surviving CLI instead of launching one**:

```go
if !agent.forceRelaunch && m.tmuxPaneHasCLIForAgent(agent) {
    m.logger.Info("CLI already running in tmux pane, skipping launch", …)
    …
    go m.pollTmuxOutputForAgent(agent, agentCtx)
    return nil
}
```
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2557-2579`)

Three things about this are worth stating precisely:

- **It is one of two reattach points, and both are early returns rather than a
  recovery routine.** The other is `ensureTmuxSession`
  (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:1922`), whose first act is
  `if m.tmuxSessionExistsForAgent(agent) { return nil }`
  (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:1923-1925`) — a surviving session is reused, not
  recreated. Boot reaches both: `main` unconditionally calls
  `agentMgr.Start(ctx, name)` for every enabled agent
  (`src/cmd/hive/main.go:3457`) and the reuse-vs-relaunch decision is taken
  inside. There is no `Adopt`, `Reattach`, or `RecoverAgents` function;
  searching for one finds only `RestoreBreaker`
  (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:8848`), which restores control metadata and is
  explicitly documented as *not* touching agent state: "a boot restore must
  never change agent state, only reattach the breaker"
  (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:8845`).

  Because reattachment is emergent from two independent early returns rather
  than an explicit path, nothing in the codebase names it, tests it end to end,
  or reports whether it happened. The only trace is a log line
  (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2558`).
- **The adoption test is a screen-scrape.** `tmuxPaneHasCLIForAgent`
  (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2185`) is one line: `paneHasCLIMarker(
  m.captureVisiblePaneForAgent(agent))`. Hive decides whether an agent's
  conversation is still alive by pattern-matching rendered terminal output.
- **It does not survive the deployment's actual restart mode.** In hosted
  operation hive restarts by rolling the pod or replacing the image, which
  destroys every tmux server in the container. The `kick_logs.go` header states
  this outright: graceful shutdown must archive scrollback because "a pod roll
  or hive image upgrade … destroys every tmux server in the container"
  (`src/pkg/agent/kick_logs.go:17-19`, `:246`).

So the reattach path helps only when the hive **process** restarts inside a
surviving **container**. For the case the RFC names — spoke rolls — it does not
apply.

---

## 3. What a restart actually does to a turn

`Restart` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:9182`) does not resume anything. In order:

1. `C-c` into the pane and cancel the launch context
   (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:9209-9213`).
2. Archive the scrollback *before* it is destroyed —
   `archiveKickLogLocked(agent, "restart")`
   (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:9218`), with the comment that `kill-session`
   destroys the only record of the previous run
   (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:9215-9217`).
3. Reap the CLI process and any UID-owned helpers
   (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:9229-9233`).
4. `tmux kill-session` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:9240`).

The replacement CLI starts with **no prompt at all** in the default case.
`buildBootstrapPrompt` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:3352`) computes a list of
candidate policy paths and then unconditionally returns `""`
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:3383`), with the reasoning recorded inline: the
governor's first eval cycle kicks all due agents with fully substituted
templates, whereas sending a boot prompt here leaked unsubstituted `${ISSUE_LIST}`
placeholders to the agent (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:3379-3382`).

So a restarted agent sits idle at its input prompt until the shared governor
ticker (§1.4) next finds it due. Only the explicit override paths supply text
directly: `RestartWithBootstrap` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:8887`) sets
`BootstrapOverride`, and `RestartThenSendKick`
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:8965`) is documented as restarting "with a clean
slate". Whichever path runs, delivery is gated on the new pane reaching its
input marker (`deliverStartupKick`, `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:4932`).

**Restart is a reset, not a resume.** Whatever the agent had established in its
conversation — plan, working context, partial tool results — is gone, and the
next thing it receives is an ordinary scheduled kick that carries no knowledge
that a restart happened or that earlier work exists.

---

## 4. The watchdog

`src/pkg/watchdog/` observes liveness and, in acting modes, restarts.

Its input is an `Observation` (`src/pkg/watchdog/classify.go:47`) whose
substantive fields are `Pane string` — the visible pane, deliberately excluding
scrollback so "stale markers in scroll history must not vouch for a dead CLI"
(`src/pkg/watchdog/classify.go:51-52`) — plus boolean verdicts derived from that
pane and a `LastChange` timestamp from the poller.

It classifies each pane into one `PaneClass`
(`src/pkg/watchdog/classify.go:13-31`): `ready`, `shell-prompt`,
`auth-required`, `stuck-overlay`, `no-output`, `no-session`, `unknown`.
`Dead()` (`src/pkg/watchdog/classify.go:37`) returns true for `shell-prompt`,
`stuck-overlay`, `no-output`, and `no-session`. `auth-required` is deliberately
excluded, because restarting into a dead credential produces a restart loop
(`src/pkg/watchdog/classify.go:33-35`). The pattern tables it matches against are
literal CLI UI chrome — `"Login expired"`, `"Please run /login"`
(`src/pkg/watchdog/classify.go:82-87`), `"[Next]"`, `"Choose an accent"`
(`src/pkg/watchdog/classify.go:92-102`).

Its action is `r.fleet.Restart(ctx, name)` (`src/pkg/watchdog/reconciler.go:632`,
via `planRestartLocked` at `:547` and `restartDetached` at `:628`) — i.e.
exactly the destructive path in §3.

**What the watchdog does about lost in-process state: nothing, and by design it
cannot.** It restores its *own* ladder across restarts
(`Snapshot`/`Restore`, `src/pkg/watchdog/reconciler.go:345` and `:379`), so it
"neither forgets a crash-loop nor re-runs a backoff ladder from the top"
(`src/pkg/watchdog/reconciler.go:373-374`). It has no mechanism to restore the
agent's conversation, because none exists to call. From the watchdog's point of
view a restarted agent is a fresh agent that happens to keep its name and its
failure count.

This is the sharpest way to state hive's current position: **the control plane
is already durable; the agent is not.**

---

## 5. Honest feasibility notes

These are constraints observed in the code, not arguments for or against the
RFC.

### 5.1 Hive does not own the conversation, and cannot read it

Every supported backend is an opaque interactive subprocess. Hive composes a
command line as a string (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2429`, `:2456`, `:2479`),
types it into a shell, and from then on interacts only through keystrokes in and
rendered characters out.

Hive sets `HOME` and a per-agent `CODEX_HOME`
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:8490`, helper at `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:7254`) so
that each agent's CLI writes its session files somewhere hive controls the
*location* of. That is location control, not format control: nothing in
`src/pkg/agent/` parses, writes, or migrates a backend session file.

Notably, **no launch path passes a resume/continue/session-id flag** to any
backend. The composed command lines carry model and permission flags only. There
is therefore no existing mechanism by which hive could ask a relaunched CLI to
pick up where the previous one stopped, even for a backend that supports it.

Consequence for the RFC: "the conversation is the durable state" presumes the
orchestrator can serialize and reload the conversation. Hive today can do
neither. Any conversation-as-state design must either (a) confine itself to
backends that expose a documented, stable resume mechanism and accept that the
envelope is backend-specific and not portable, or (b) move agents off opaque
interactive CLIs onto an API-shaped backend hive drives itself. Both are
substantially larger than "externalize hive's state", and the choice between
them is a real fork the RFC does not currently name. This spike takes no
position on which.

### 5.2 The two durable records hive does keep are not conversations

It is easy to mistake either for one; neither is.

- `/data/prompt-history.jsonl` holds the **input half only**. It is the
  fully-expanded prompt text of every kick
  (`src/pkg/dashboard/prompt_history.go:44`, `:365`). The file's own header
  explains it exists because the alternatives — in-memory `LastKickMessage` and
  the 120-character `KickRecord.Snippet` — could not answer "what was my agent
  asked to do?" (`src/pkg/dashboard/prompt_history.go:21-34`). No model
  response, tool call, or tool result is recorded.
- `/data/logs/kicks/…` holds **rendered terminal text**, captured with
  `tmux capture-pane -p -J` (`src/pkg/agent/kick_logs.go:167-171`). It is a
  human debugging artifact, retained to 10 files / 64 MiB per agent
  (`src/pkg/agent/kick_logs.go:48`, `:59`). It contains ANSI-rendered,
  width-wrapped, spinner-animated output with no message boundaries and no
  role structure. It is not machine-replayable into any backend.

Together these mean hive can already tell you *what it asked* and *what the
screen looked like*, and still cannot reconstruct *what the model's state was*.

### 5.3 The state envelope precedent already exists

Whatever shape a handoff envelope takes, hive has a working pattern for it:
`snapshot.PersistedState` (`src/pkg/snapshot/state.go:16`), saved atomically via
a `.tmp` + rename (`src/pkg/snapshot/state.go:113`), aged out at seven days
(`src/pkg/snapshot/state.go:14`), restored at boot by
`restoreAgentRuntimeState` (`src/cmd/hive/state_restore.go`). The watchdog's
`PersistedAgent` (`src/pkg/watchdog/reconciler.go:187`) shows how a subsystem
contributes a durable subset of its in-memory record to that envelope without
persisting the whole thing, including the judgement call about *which* fields
are safe to restore under which mode
(`src/pkg/watchdog/reconciler.go:376-382`).

If step 2 externalizes manager-side state, this is the mechanism to extend
rather than a new one to invent.

### 5.4 Everything hive knows about an agent's progress is screen-scraped

This is the load-bearing constraint behind all of the above and is worth
isolating. Turn completion (§1.3), liveness classification (§4), stall
detection (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:5597`), auth failure
(`src/pkg/watchdog/classify.go:82`), quota exhaustion
(`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:289`), and even whether a surviving CLI can be
adopted (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:2185`) are all decided by matching substrings
against rendered terminal output.

A structured turn return value — the RFC's testability and subagent-sync
benefits — is not a refactor of an existing structured signal. There is no
structured signal. It would be a new capability, and it requires a channel to
the backend that hive does not currently have.

---

## 6. Step 2 prototype: a re-entrant contribute turn

The additive prototype in [`pkg/turn`](../../pkg/turn/) takes the smallest
headless slice that exercises the RFC's state claim without pretending the tmux
path can provide a structured conversation. Its public transition is:

```text
Step(SessionEnvelope, optional initial TurnPlan)
    -> (SessionEnvelope, TurnOutput, error)
```

It carries the operation-journal lesson previously exercised on the earlier
`v5` line in [#4053](https://github.com/hivecommons/hive/pull/4053) onto current
`v4`, and adds the real atomic file store plus fail-closed handling for effects
that cannot be reconciled.

The first invocation binds the ordered plan into the envelope. A later process
receives only the serialized envelope and calls `Step` with no plan. The
envelope carries the conversation, task and agent identity, bound operation
plan, operation journal, status, and terminal contribute verdict. The return is
structured (`status`, `done`, `verdict`, `rationale`, landed effects); no pane
substring decides whether the turn finished.

This is a prototype boundary, not a new production path. It does not call an
LLM, replace a backend CLI, or run from `bin/contributor-relay.sh`. A headless
backend adapter would produce the initial plan; the spike starts immediately
after that model call, where re-entry meets external side effects and where a
duplicate is more damaging than repeated inference.

### 6.1 Durable operation protocol

Each side-effectful operation has a stable key derived from:

```text

```

The model's tool-call ID is recorded for traceability but excluded from the
key, because a repeated inference can mint a new call ID for the same semantic
effect. Keys are bound into the plan before persistence, so scrub-on-persist
cannot change operation identity.

An operation crosses two durable boundaries:

1. Write `intended` to the envelope and commit it before the external write.
2. Perform the write.
3. Write `succeeded` or `failed` and commit again.

On re-entry, `succeeded` short-circuits. `intended` is the ambiguous crash
window: the write may have landed before the process died, so the runner asks a
remote reconciler before proceeding. If no reconciler exists, it fails closed
with `ErrAmbiguous`; it does not blindly replay. This is stricter than
at-least-once delivery and deliberately trades manual recovery for never
silently creating a duplicate PR or comment.

`FileStore` makes those boundaries real rather than test-only: it serializes
through the fleet's `logscrub` boundary, writes a mode-`0600` temporary file,
syncs it, and atomically renames it over the prior envelope. The in-memory
conversation is not redacted or mutated; only the artifact that can cross a
process or spoke boundary is scrubbed.

### 6.2 What the replay test establishes

`TestStepReentersAtEveryPersistenceBoundary` drives a contribute-shaped turn
(comment → push → PR create → label), kills it before every intent, settle, and
terminal-envelope commit, discards all in-memory state, reloads only serialized
JSON, and re-enters. Every case must produce:

- exactly one call per external effect;
- the same ordered effect summary and `shipped` verdict as an uninterrupted
  control;
- no ambiguous journal entries at completion.

Separate tests prove that an ambiguous operation without reconciliation never
replays, a known-not-landed operation does run, a failed operation can retry,
semantic keys survive a freshly minted tool-call ID, and the persisted artifact
contains no credential-shaped plaintext. `pkg/turn` remains above the
repository's 90% package coverage floor under `go test -race`.

### 6.3 What step 2 does not establish

1. **Inference is outside the envelope transition.** A crash before the plan is
   committed repeats inference and may produce a different plan. The prototype
   protects landed effects, not token cost or plan determinism.
2. **Reconciliation is effect-specific.** PR-by-head has a good remote
   surrogate; pushes and high-traffic comments do not. Those effects stop as
   ambiguous instead of claiming exactly-once semantics they cannot provide.
3. **There is no concurrency claim.** The journal makes sequential re-entry
   safe. It does not let two processes race one envelope. Step 3 must reuse the
   contributor relay's existing offer→claim ownership rather than create a
   fifth durable-state store or parallel claim system.
4. **No backend conversation is captured.** The package proves the envelope
   and side-effect protocol after a structured headless response. It does not
   resolve §5.1's backend-native-resume versus API-shaped-backend fork.
5. **The beads comparison is not measured.** A bead checkpoint can carry task
   notes, but not this operation journal or a structured backend response today.
   Step 4 still needs the proposed kill-at-50% comparison before recommending
   the larger migration.

## Open questions

Things this spike did not establish, and what would settle each.

1. **Do the supported backends expose a stable resume mechanism, and is its
   session format documented?** Not investigated here — it is a property of
   claude / copilot / bob / agy, not of hive, and no hive code exercises it.
   Settling it requires per-backend version-pinned testing against the actual
   binaries, since an undocumented on-disk format is not a contract.
2. **Should the manager-side nudge and restart counters join the persisted
   envelope?** `tokenRestartAttempts` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:285`),
   `transientNudgesThisKick` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:317`), and
   `stallNudgeSent` (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:312`) are loop-breakers that
   reset to zero on restart, while the watchdog's equivalent ladder is
   deliberately persisted (`src/pkg/watchdog/reconciler.go:373`). Whether the
   difference is intentional (these counters are per-launch by design, and a
   fresh launch legitimately deserves a fresh budget) or an oversight is not
   determinable from the code alone and was not raised as a defect by this
   spike. Confirming it needs the author's intent, not more reading.
3. **What is the actual observed restart rate, and how much work is lost per
   restart?** ~~The RFC's motivation is "frequent spoke rolls", but this spike
   found no metric that quantifies work discarded by a restart.~~ **An
   instrument now exists** (`src/pkg/agent/turn_loss.go`); the question is
   awaiting fleet data rather than awaiting a way to collect it. See
   [Measuring the motivation](#measuring-the-motivation-open-question-3) below.
4. **Is `buildBootstrapPrompt`'s path-building dead code, or a staging post?**
   The function assembles a candidate policy-file list
   (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:3366-3378`) and then discards it by returning `""`
   (`src/pkg/agent/manager.go:3383`). The `return ""` is deliberate and
   explained, but whether the now-unused path construction above it should be
   removed or is being kept for a planned re-enable is not answerable from the
   code. Flagged as an observation, not filed as a defect.
5. **Are there non-tmux agent execution paths with different properties?**
   `src/pkg/agent/sandbox_executor.go` runs a different shape of execution
   (`src/pkg/agent/sandbox_executor.go:309` composes its own command line) and
   inference backends are handled separately
   (`IsInferenceBackend`, `src/pkg/agent/manager.go:672`). This spike scoped
   itself to the tmux CLI path, which is the fleet's normal mode; the sandbox
   and inference paths were not mapped and may not share these constraints.

## Measuring the motivation (open question 3)

The RFC argues from "frequent spoke rolls discard agent work". That premise was
unsized: `RestartCount` (`src/pkg/snapshot/state.go`) counts restarts and says
nothing about what any of them cost. Step 4's feasibility call depends on the
difference, and the measurement is cheap next to a prototype — so it is now
instrumented, in `src/pkg/agent/turn_loss.go`.

**What is counted.** A turn is interrupted when hive tears down an agent's CLI
and tmux session while a delivered kick's output has not yet been rotated
(`kickLogPending`) — the restart and shutdown paths, funnelled through
`tearDownTurnLocked`. Ordinary kick rotation is deliberately excluded: a kick is
only delivered into a pane sitting at its input marker, so rotation means the
previous turn finished, and counting it would bury the signal in completed work.

**Why two clocks, and why neither alone is honest.** `kickLogPending` means
"output not archived", which is not the same as "the turn was still running": an
agent that finished and then sat idle for an hour still carries pending output.
Charging that hour to the restart would overstate the loss — an overclaim in
favour of the RFC, produced by the RFC's own instrument, which is exactly the
result nobody should trust. So each record carries:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SinceKick` | Teardown minus kick delivery. An **upper bound** on what the interruption could have cost — never a measurement of what it did. |
| `SinceOutput` | Teardown minus the last observed pane change. A large value beside a large `SinceKick` says the agent was idle and little was lost. Nil means the pane poller never saw a change, which reads as **unknown** and must never be read as idle. |
| `Producing` | Whether the pane changed *after* the kick landed — the agent did something this turn. Binary and threshold-free, which is why the aggregate carries it: "interruptions that hit an agent doing work" is answerable across the fleet without anyone first agreeing how many idle seconds count as idle. Unknown resolves to false. |
| `Bytes` | Archived scrollback at teardown, a proxy for the volume of turn output discarded. |

Analysis discounts with `SinceOutput`; the instrument does not decide for it.
Deciding would be taking step 4's judgement inside a tool built to inform it.

**Where it lands.** Per-agent aggregates plus a bounded tail of individual
records ride the existing `/data/hive-state.json` through
`snapshot.AgentTurnLoss` — not a sidecar, per the maintainer caution against
adding durable store number five — and are re-seeded at boot
(`SeedTurnLoss`), because a counter that reset on restart would reset on exactly
the event it exists to count. Each interruption is also logged as
`audit: turn interrupted mid-flight`, so the fleet-wide question is answerable
from log aggregation without reading every spoke's PVC.

**Reading it.** The headline is `producing / interruptions` — the share of
teardowns that certainly discarded work — with `upper_bound_s` as the ceiling on
cost and the `recent` tail showing the shape (a few long turns vs. many short
ones):

```bash
jq '.agents | to_entries[] | select(.value.turn_loss)
    | {agent: .key, interruptions: .value.turn_loss.interruptions,
       producing: .value.turn_loss.producing,
       upper_bound_s: .value.turn_loss.upper_bound_s}' /data/hive-state.json
```

**What it still does not answer.** It sizes what a teardown *discards*, not what
recovery would *cost*, so it does not by itself settle the beads-checkpointing
comparison raised on the issue — that needs the killed-at-50% experiment, which
wants this baseline first. And it measures the tmux CLI path only: the sandbox
and inference paths (open question 5) have different teardown semantics and are
not instrumented here.

**Status: instrument only.** It changes nothing about when or how an agent is
torn down. `tearDownTurnLocked` replaces three hand-copied archive-then-clear
blocks with one funnel so the accounting cannot drift between the restart paths,
and is otherwise behaviour-preserving.

## What this page does not say

It does not say the RFC is infeasible, and it does not say it is worthwhile.
Step 4 is where that judgement belongs, and it should be made with §5.1's fork
named explicitly and Open question 3 answered.

Step 3 — the handoff evaluation — is now written up separately in
[Evaluating a handoff path for the re-entrant turn model](agent-turn-handoff.md).
It re-checks §6.3's residuals against `v4`, and reports that §5.1's fork is no
longer deferrable: the envelope it describes is handoff-able on the headless
path only.
