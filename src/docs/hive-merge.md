# `hive-merge` — merge a PR as the App bot

`bin/hive-merge.sh` is how an agent merges a pull request. Agents call it
**instead of the GitHub MCP `merge_pull_request` tool** (or a GraphQL
`mergePullRequest` mutation). GitHub rejects that mutation for App
installation tokens with "Resource not accessible by integration" even when
the token holds `contents:write` + `pull_requests:write`. The hive merges the
PR over REST with the App token instead, which succeeds — so the merge is
authored by the App bot (`<slug>[bot]`) and uses the transport that actually
works for an App token.

It does not merge the PR itself. It writes a request file that the hive's
merge-request watcher picks up and acts on.

## Why it exists

Two reasons.

**Transport.** The MCP/GraphQL merge path is rejected outright for App
installation tokens. Routing through the hive's REST-based merge path is not
optional convenience — it's the only path that works.

**Authorization + forge resistance.** The script runs **as the agent**, in
that agent's tmux session under that agent's UID, so the request file it
writes is owned by that UID. The watcher re-derives the requesting agent from
the **file's owner**, not from anything written inside the file. `hive-merge`
**adds no privilege**: the watcher enforces the same per-agent forge-resistance
check and a `CanMerge` ACMM gate (`AuthorizeMerge`) that a direct merge would
need — an agent whose mode allows opening PRs but not merging them still
cannot merge through this path.

On top of `AuthorizeMerge`, the watcher's authorizer is wrapped with a second,
target-specific check (the F4 target-binding, CWE-863) before any merge is
attempted:

- the request must carry a non-empty `expect_sha` — an empty expected SHA
  would mean "merge whatever HEAD is now," which is a TOCTOU hole: a commit
  pushed after the PR was judged eligible could get merged unseen;
- the `(repo, number)` pair must currently appear in the governor's
  merge-eligible list **at that exact head SHA** — so an agent cannot request
  landing an arbitrary reachable PR (including its own) merely because its
  checks happen to be green; it must be a PR the hive's governor already
  deemed eligible, at the commit it reviewed.

Both the agent/UID/`CanMerge` check and this target-binding check must pass
before the merge is attempted.

**The hive does not force-merge.** With admin bypass disabled, GitHub still
enforces branch protection (required checks like build-gate). A PR whose
required checks aren't green fails here, and the result file records why.

**The hive verifies CI itself, and absent is not passing.** Branch protection
is not the only gate: before any merge is attempted the watcher requires
*positive* CI confirmation on the pinned head SHA (#6173). On a base branch
with no protection rules GitHub refuses nothing, so previously a red PR, or
one whose workflows all died at startup with zero jobs (and therefore zero
check runs and an empty status rollup), merged on request. The watcher now
computes its own verdict:

- **green** - at least one commit status or check run exists on the SHA, every
  gating one has succeeded (`neutral`/`skipped` count as success, the
  non-required ignore list still applies), every config-declared required
  check has reported, and no workflow run on the SHA failed without producing
  a job. The merge proceeds.
- **pending** - a gating check is still queued/in progress, a required check
  has not been created yet, or a workflow run is in flight without a job. The
  request is parked (`ci_waits` in the result file, no attempt consumed) and
  re-evaluated next tick, for up to `mergeRequestMaxCIWaits` ticks.
- **red** - a gating check failed, or a workflow run concluded failure with
  zero jobs. Refused; counts as a failed attempt and, at the retry limit, is
  classified and re-engaged into the fix loop like a branch-protection
  refusal.
- **unverified** - zero statuses, zero check runs, zero workflow runs. GitHub
  has no verdict, so neither does the hive. Refused; quarantined at the retry
  limit with the reason in the result file.

An API error while gathering that evidence is a failed attempt, never a pass.

## Usage

```sh
hive-merge --repo <owner/repo> --number <N> [--method squash|merge|rebase] \
           [--expect-sha <sha>] [--update-branch]
```

| Flag | Required | Default |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| `--repo` | yes | — |
| `--number` (alias `--pr`) | yes | — |
| `--method` | no | `squash` |
| `--expect-sha` | no | auto-resolved (see below) |
| `--update-branch` | no | off |

Both `--flag value` and `--flag=value` forms work. `--squash`, `--merge`, and
`--rebase` are accepted as method shorthands. `--admin` is accepted and
**ignored** — the hive never admin-bypasses branch protection.

`--repo` and `--number` must resolve, or the script exits `2`. `--number` must
be an integer, or the script exits `2`.

### `--expect-sha` is auto-resolved, not optional in effect

The merge-request watcher **requires** a non-empty `expect_sha` (the F4 TOCTOU
guard above) — a request with none is denied outright. Rather than push that
burden onto every call site, the script resolves the PR's *current* head SHA
itself when `--expect-sha` is not given, using the cached App token at
`/var/run/hive-metrics/gh-app-token.cache`, and pins it into the request. The
head is captured at request time, closing the TOCTOU window exactly as
intended, so existing call sites that never passed `--expect-sha` keep
working unchanged.

If the SHA cannot be resolved (no token cache, `gh` unavailable, or the
lookup fails), the script prints an error naming the token-cache path and
**exits `3`** rather than writing a request with no pinned head.

### `--update-branch`

When set, the watcher syncs the PR branch with its base before attempting the
merge (resolves the common "behind main" case). A failure to update the
branch is not fatal — the merge attempt still proceeds and surfaces the real
blocker.

## It is asynchronous, by design

On success the script prints the request path and returns `0`. **The PR has
not been merged yet at that point.** It merges on the next watcher tick
(polling every 10 seconds).

To confirm, poll the `.result.json` written next to the request file, or
simply check whether the PR is merged.

## Retries and what happens when a merge can't land

The watcher retries a failed merge attempt up to **3 attempts total**,
tracked across ticks via the prior `.result.json`. What happens after the
final attempt depends on why it failed:

- **A required check is failing or pending** (classified from GitHub's own
  branch-protection error text, e.g. "required status check ... has not
  succeeded") — the request is quarantined (renamed `.exhausted`), but the
  hive re-engages its fix loop for that PR instead of abandoning it, subject
  to a per-red-SHA re-dispatch cap.
- **The blocker is unfixable by pushing code** — a true merge conflict or a
  permission error (matched against GitHub's own wording, e.g. "merge
  conflict", "not accessible by integration", "403", "must be a member") —
  the request is quarantined (`.exhausted`) and not retried further; the
  result file records the last error.

An authorization denial (forge-resistance failure, `CanMerge` gate failure,
or F4 target-binding failure) is not retried at all — the request file is
renamed `.denied` immediately and the result file records the reason.

A malformed request file (invalid JSON) is renamed `.bad`.

## Where things live

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `/var/run/hive-metrics/merge-requests` | request files the watcher consumes |
| `/var/run/hive-metrics/gh-app-token.cache` | cached App token, used to auto-resolve `--expect-sha` |
| `/var/run/hive/uid-map.json` | UID → agent-name map, used for a nicer log line |

The UID map is **informational only** here. The watcher re-derives ownership
from the file's UID regardless.
