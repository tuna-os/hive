	// automaxprocs sets GOMAXPROCS to match the container's CPU quota (Linux
	// CFS) at init. Without it the Go runtime sizes its P count to the whole
	// NODE's core count, so on a many-core IKS worker a pod limited to a few
	// CPUs spawns far more runnable Ps than its CFS quota can service; when the
	// quota is exhausted mid-period EVERY goroutine — including the netpoller
	// that answers the :3002 liveness probe and the heartbeat loop — is
	// throttled until the next CFS period, which stacks on top of the NFS
	// stalls to push probe latency past the kubelet timeout. Matching GOMAXPROCS
	// to the quota removes that self-inflicted throttling.
	//
	// This is called explicitly rather than via the package's blank import
	// because that import's init writes a line to the default logger (stderr)
	// unconditionally. `hive` re-execs itself as a Git transport shim, and the
	// setup path captures a child's stdout and stderr into a single buffer to
	// parse (e.g. `symbolic-ref --short origin/HEAD`), so an init-time banner
	// is indistinguishable from Git's answer and corrupts the parsed branch
	// name. Setting it with a no-op logger keeps the GOMAXPROCS behaviour and
	// drops the banner.

// WHY THE /data PREFERENCE MATTERS
//
// A hub-delivered key lands at spokeAppKeyPath (/data, on the PVC) and the
// heartbeat callback repoints cfg.GitHub.KeyFile at it — but only in memory, for
// the life of that process. A hive whose config carries NO key_file (which is
// the state of the three live GHE hives this repairs) used to fall straight
// through to the read-only /secrets provisioning mount. That mount holds the
// stale, wrong key, and the spoke cannot write to it. So on every restart the
// hive would silently go back to signing with the key that cannot work, and the
// hub — seeing the wrong fingerprint reported again — would redeliver forever.
// The key would be delivered and never used: a fault that reads as fixed.
//
// So when nothing is explicitly configured, a key already present on the PVC is
// preferred over the provisioning mount. An EXPLICIT key_file or env override
// still wins outright: those are deliberate, and this must not silently redirect
// an operator who named a path.
//
// PER-APP-ID SELECTION (the both-keys fix)
//
// appID is the App this process is configured to authenticate AS
// (cfg.GitHub.AppID). When the hub has delivered a per-app-id key for exactly
// that App — /data/gh-app-key-<appID>.pem — it is preferred over the generic
// single-file paths, because it is provably the RIGHT key for the app_id we
// claim. This is what lets a github.com hive on a GitHub-Enterprise cluster sign
// with the github.com key even though its cluster default (and its single
// /data/gh-app-key.pem) is the GHE key. It sits just below an explicit
// key_file/env override — an operator who named a path still wins — and above
// the generic fallbacks. appID <= 0 disables it entirely, so nothing changes for
// a hive that reports no app_id.

		// see a per-app-id key for the app_id we actually claim, that key is
		// correct by construction and the generic pin is stale, so ignore it.
		//
		// Without this, the ~33 spokes already carrying
		// key_file: /data/gh-app-key.pem keep signing with whichever App's key
